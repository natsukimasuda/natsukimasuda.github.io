                        <p>My name is Natsuki Masuda. My best friends describe me as extroverted, inventive and adaptable. My hobbies include reading, travelling, filming and listening to people talk whether it be in person or TED talks. My go-to method to get to know a friend is through his or her favorite music and book. I am currently reading “Predictably Irrational” by Dan Ariely. I’m always up for trying new food, activities, and books.

                        I have been teaching myself to code through Codeacademy since the summer of junior year. Coding fascinates me because of its unlimited potential to create. I started with basics like HTML and CSS and moved on to more advance languages such as Javascript and Python. For my free style, I wanted to deliver my information through a creative medium. This website is in fact written from complete scratch without a framework. I hope you enjoy! </p>

                        <p>Throughout my high school career, I took on four different seasonal sports – volleyball, basketball, soccer and softball. Playing sports was a great medium to meet new friends outside the classroom. We practice two hours a day, three times a week and attend local and international competitions. I got to travel with my team to compete in different countries such as Hong Kong, China and Vietnam. As a team, we learned how to turn the heartbreak of defeat into motivation to become better. The lessons I learned about teamwork and communication are invaluable. By the end, we were family. </p>

                        <p> Model United Nations is an extracurricular activity that simulates conferences held at United Nations. We meet for two hours on Tuesdays through Thursdays to discuss resolutions that are based on real world issues such as Non-Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We debate on the behalf of a nation’s delegation to pass resolutions that align with their interests. I undergo prior research in order to accurately represent a nation, and this deepens my involvement in current events. Throughout the sessions, I have represented countries like Italy and Korea to explore global issues through various cultural lenses. MUN has been a big step to becoming the kind of individual I aspire to be in the future. As mentioned in my video, I will travel to Beijing this March to attend an international MUN conference with over 800 students from 40 different schools to represent the United States at Security Council. </p>

                        <p>During the summer before my senior year, I had the opportunity to intern at the club lounge at Ritz-Carlton Osaka. I set up tables, brewed coffee, greeted guests and assisted their check-ins. In the beginning of my internship, I was nervous and felt out of place. However, with time, I was able to adapt to my surroundings and act more comfortably around guests. The experience that was most valuable was the conversations with the guests. I talked to CEOs, environmental activists, designers, and entrepreneurs. By reaching out, I was able to learn about about their experiences and expertise. My internship was a memorable and lasting experience. At Keio University, I would love to pursue internships and actively seek opportunities. I intend to continue initiating conversation to learn with and through others.</p>

                <p>In the future, I aspire to contribute to the society through international relations. My interest in international relations spurred at a young age because I grew up in an international environment and issues in international relations has always been relevant to me. With age, I have grown to understand the complexity of the contemporary global issues. I realized that I needed to approach my education from a variety of angles, and Keio allows me to do that through its Frontier and Creativity Courses. Furthermore, I would like to actively pursue opportunities, and create a strong network with the outstanding faculty and motivated student body. I look to diligently study until graduate school to establish a solid foundation of knowledge to pursue my future aspirations. At Keio University, I promise to work hard and not take opportunities for granted.</p>
